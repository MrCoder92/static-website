AWS Static Website using S3 and Route 53
In this project, I hosted a Static Website using Amazon S3 and Route 53 while keeping in mind Securities Best Practices, to achive the goal.

#Create custome domain using the Amazon Route 53
Head to the Amazon Route 53 to create/purchase your domain. It can take 10 minutes or maximum 3 days to successfuly activate the domain. 
When successfully activated you will receive a confirmation email. Ones confirmed, head to the Amazon S3 to create your bucket.


#Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a sample website
Create an Amazon S3 bucket. This bucket will be used to host the website.
Make sure your bucket name is the same as your domain name. 
Select a region close to your location to reduce latency
Uncheck the Block All Public Access to make the website publicly accessible to users.
Acknoeledge the warning and keep the rest as default and select create bucket. 

Click into your bucket name (domain) and select upload to upload your website (in code)

#Enable a static website hosting and direct the domain to the S3 bucket
Make sure the website is enabled for static website hosting and has the right permissions for users to access it 
Select properties and scroll all the way to the bottum to Static website hosting
By default it is disabled, select edit and type the default page for the website; in this case (index.html) and save changes

Now click on permissions to add/attach bucket policies
click edit and attach your bucket policies and click save changes 

We have now configured the bucket to have a sample website publicly accessible to viewers
